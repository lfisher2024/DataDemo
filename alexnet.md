# AlexNet: A Breakthrough in Deep Learning and Computer Vision

## Abstract
AlexNet is one of the most influential Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in the field of artificial intelligence. Created in 2012, it dramatically improved the ability of computers to recognize and classify images. This report explains AlexNet in detail, including its history, structure, significance, and potential applications, especially in the domain of marine biology and oceanic fish studies.

## 1. Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) allows computers to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. One key area is **computer vision**, which enables machines to "see" and interpret the visual world. Traditional image processing relied on hand-crafted features, but deep learning allows computers to automatically learn these features from data.  

AlexNet is a landmark **deep learning model** that significantly advanced computer vision by using **deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)**.

## 2. Historical Context

- **Year Created:** 2012  
- **Creators:** Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton  
- **Purpose:** To participate in the **ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC)**, a competition to classify images into 1,000 categories.  
- **Impact:** AlexNet reduced the error rate in image classification by over 10% compared to previous methods, sparking a surge in deep learning research.

## 3. What is AlexNet?

AlexNet is a **deep convolutional neural network**. At a high level:

- **Input:** Images (e.g., photographs of objects, animals, or scenes)  
- **Output:** A prediction of what the image contains (e.g., cat, dog, fish)  
- **Layers:** AlexNet consists of **8 layers**, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.  

### 3.1. Convolutional Layers
Convolutional layers act like **filters** that scan the image to detect features, such as edges, colors, textures, and shapes.

*Diagram Idea: Show a small grid image being scanned by a filter, producing a feature map.*

### 3.2. Pooling Layers
Pooling layers **simplify the data** by taking the most important features and reducing the image size, making the network more efficient.

*Diagram Idea: Show a 4x4 grid shrinking into a 2x2 grid by picking maximum values.*

### 3.3. Fully Connected Layers
Fully connected layers **combine all detected features** to make the final prediction.

*Diagram Idea: Connect all features from the previous layers into one node that outputs a class prediction.*
